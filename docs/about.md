The Computer Programs Services (CPS) of the Nuclear Energy Agency is responsible for collection, testing, and distributing nuclear computer code and data libraries. It now employs an git repository for ease of access to some of its codes. 

Features offered by this repository include: 

* Searching for, and requesting access to open source codes of interest.
* Reporting bugs and issues found in open source and restricted codes.
* Contributing to codes housed in the git-based catalogues.
* Submitting new revisions and updates to exisiting codes (for approved code owners and developers).

Access to codes through this platform is wholly digital and proficiency with git-based coding is a prerequisite. Some quick git tips are provided for beginners [here](../git/){:target="_blank"}.  

This service in no way changes the conventional way in which CPS distributes nuclear computer codes via DVDs. Users desiring a physical copy of codes mailed to them should submit such requests [here](https://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/list){:target="_blank"}.
